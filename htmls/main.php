        In the Student Performance Evaluation System is a system where the student 
        will get the details about his/her performance in their respected year. The student
        should login using their Seat number in their respected year section. The student will see
        his/her performance there. The Teachers role here is to add the students information accoring to 
        their year so that when the student will login using his seat number then he/she will be able
        to check out their performance report. The admin will add the autorized teachers information only when the teachers credentials are valid the teacher will be able to login and will be able to add the students marks there by avoilding any means of cheating.
